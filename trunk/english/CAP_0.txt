I  Who is this for

This guide offers a lot of concepts from subjects like software engineering,
structured and object oriented programming to referring to the available APIs of
the Amiga platform. We recommend the reader follow the suggested links during
the guide, in order to obtain a better point of view about the methodologies we
will reference. Every subject will be handled in a simulated form sometimes,
leaving the task of mastering the subject to the reader, using reference texts
which will always be suggested here.

Knowledge explained in this guide is easily accessible to those who know what a
compiler is and who have a basic knowledge of the C programming language.
If you don't have this knowledge, please read the following C courses first:
