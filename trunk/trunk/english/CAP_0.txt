I  Who is this for


This guide offers a lot of concepts from subjects like software engineering,
structured and object oriented programming, referring to the available APIs of
the Amiga platform. We recommend the reader to follow the suggested links during
the guide, in order to obtain a larger point of view about the methodologies we
will refer to. Every subject will be handled in a synthetic form sometimes,
leaving the task of mastering the subject to the reader, using reference texts
which will be always suggested here.

Knowledges explained in this guide are easily accessible to who knows what a
compiler is and who have a basic knowledge of the C programming language.
If you don't have these knowledges, please read the following C courses first:

http://programmazione.html.it/guide/leggi/32/guida-c/   #EVENTUALMENTE SOSTITUIRE CON UNA INGLESE

The above course have a section explaining the useful software to program, to
which you must add those suggested in the chapter 2 of this guide.
